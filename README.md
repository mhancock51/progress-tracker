# Fitness Tracker
Next.JS | TypeScript | ShadCN | GMAIL API \
The goal of this project was to solve a real world issue I had with an existing third-party app that I used to track my gym sessions.
The main issue was that the app allowed you to log your sessions and progress but the feature to visualise and track your progress was locked behind a paywall and the premium features didn't fit my use case, so I built this next.js web app.

## Features
- GitHub styled heatmap to track my consistancy with sessions
- Configurable "gold band" to highlight the weeks I've met my weekly session target (default is 3)
- Aggregated data cards such as average session length, cardio per session, etc.
- Automatic importing of the "takeout" csv file from the app to your inbox to the web app
